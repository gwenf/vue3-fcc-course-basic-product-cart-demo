## Building

As with most repos with a package.json, try running `npm ci` from the root of the repository.
However, because node-sass is compiled from C++ and depends on node's API structures, sass's version is pretty tightly coupled to nodes's version.
You'll need to tweak the version of see errors like this in the results of `npm ci`:

As of node v18.8.0, `node-sass@^9.0.0` gave a clean install. Try `npm i -D node-sass@latest` or specify a version Ã  la `npm i -D node-sass@^9.0.0`.
To pick a version, type `node --version` and look in [node-sass's README](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#node-version-support-policy) for the corresponding version of node-sass.
